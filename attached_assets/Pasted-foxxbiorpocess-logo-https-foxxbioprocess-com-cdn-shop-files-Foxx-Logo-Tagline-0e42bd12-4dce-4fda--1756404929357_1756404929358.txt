I want to create a newsletteer managing dashboard where I want to create a newsletter popup like this see imaege
so what I want is I have a shopify website where what I want to to create a system see
see imaeg 2 where first if the user added  the site see imaeg 2   and  3
so first if the admin select the shopify site where it want to show this newsletter popup see
imaeg 2 right now only focus on shopify based website 
leter we can add another option so once it add then seee imaeg 4  then see the js

script have created for this store  so we need to add  this script under head like google analyztics  provide  the js script to add on site once ti added and verified  then ti able to crawl all website data
so  we dothe same ocne the  scrpt generate dthen see imaeg 5 
then see the onboard dashboard 
see imaeg 6 so this is just a refernce dashboard so for me I dont all thi optoons
so under the dashhboard  wehat you do I have a optons to add the newsletter popup text content and also what type of field I want email, phpno name, address, company and all 
I have a options to choose
then I only want to accept the company emaol id not any email id like for example

adarsh@foxxlifesciences.com 

only company id acceeptabel then once also  see imaeg 7 
so this kind of setup seeting I want add under the dashboard also the preview how does it look allso once the 

email id added so once ti verified by the db that is tis not the exising meial id so I want to show the confirmation to that user and once it subscribed to the newsletter so I dont want to show the enwsletter popup againn to the user in the same browsers where th website open and newsletter it opened

also i want to send the email also once the confirmatio showing so the email should be the the discount code coupon
so this code  is applicable to that user  to get the 15% discount also integrate the nodeemaoler I have to send the udpated form 

updates@foxxbioprocess.com so I have the email id and password for the nodeemailer malle sure  mail should be going with full auithenticaity and not going on spam

in the entire store discoutn is manageble by the shopify I already created the discutn and added the setging under the shopif but you have given the option to add the dicoiutn name coupon name whichh I want to send


also I want to see all the user list also in the separate page the time it subscriebd and also use the 


shopify acces token so fetch that this customer is avail the discoitn code or not in the checkout
